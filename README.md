This repository contains comprehensive reports for my cybersecurity module assignment, divided into two core components: Penetration Testing and Digital Forensic Investigation. All tasks were carried out in secure, university-provided virtual environments—specifically, a Windows Server 2008 machine for penetration testing and a compromised Windows 10 system for forensic analysis.

1. Penetration Testing
For the penetration testing portion, I was provided access to a Windows Server 2008 environment with the objective of identifying and exploiting potential vulnerabilities. The report outlines the full assessment lifecycle, including:

Reconnaissance & Information Gathering: Initial network scanning and enumeration to identify active hosts, services, and potential vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Assessment: Detailed evaluation of discovered weaknesses, referencing relevant CVEs and their associated risk levels.

Exploitation: Step-by-step documentation of successful exploits, supported with annotated screenshots for validation.

Post-Exploitation: Analysis of the impact, privilege escalation opportunities, and mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: Summary of findings, reflection on the system’s overall security posture, and lessons learned during the process.

2. Digital Forensic Investigation
The forensic investigation focused on a Windows 10 machine intentionally infected for academic purposes. The aim was to uncover indicators of compromise, analyze attacker activity, and recommend remediation steps. The report includes:

Acquisition: Explanation of forensic imaging techniques and the tools used to maintain evidence integrity.

Investigation: Detailed analysis of system artifacts, registry hives, event logs, and suspicious executables.

Evidence Collection: Screenshots and data extracts demonstrating malicious activity and supporting the investigation.

Analysis: Interpretation of findings to reconstruct the timeline of the attack, persistence mechanisms, and signs of data exfiltration.

Recommendations: Actionable recovery measures and best practices to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Documentation & Methodology
Both reports are presented with a structured approach, including clear methodologies, step-by-step processes, and fully annotated screenshots. All tools, scripts, and commands used throughout the assessments are thoroughly documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Note: All activities were conducted within isolated lab environments for academic purposes, following ethical hacking and digital forensic investigation standards.
